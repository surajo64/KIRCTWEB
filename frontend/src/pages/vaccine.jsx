          Organization Overview
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Kano Independent Research Centre Trust (KIRCT) is the largest
          standalone biomedical research institute in terms of physical size in
          West Africa and one of the largest in Africa. It is situated in Kano
          State, the most populous state in Nigeria. Kano is a hotspot for
          vaccine-preventable diseases, and its strategic position as a
          commercial hub connects residents with nearby states and neighboring
          countries such as Niger and Chad.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
          KIRCT has a well-structured system with adequate infrastructure,
          state-of-the-art genomic and molecular biology laboratories, a
          hospital complex, and trained personnel to ensure the safe, effective,
          and efficient administration of vaccines. The Centre plays a vital
          role across the vaccine value chain—from research and development
          (R&D) to post-vaccine monitoring and surveillance.

          Genomics and Molecular Laboratory for Vaccine Research
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Genomics is crucial for developing, improving, and personalizing
          immunization strategies. It enhances understanding of immune responses
          and management of vaccine-preventable diseases. KIRCT’s Genomics and
          Molecular Biology Laboratory is fully equipped for molecular analysis
          (PCR, next-generation sequencing, genomic and epigenomic analyses) and
          houses a growing biorepository. The Centre is ready for vaccine-related
          basic science collaborations and serves as a hub for genomics research
          in northern Nigeria.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          KIRCT has expertise in all stages of vaccine R&D — from pathogen
          understanding to preclinical development, clinical trials, and
          post-implementation evaluation. The Centre conducts surveillance and
          social science research on vaccine-preventable diseases to improve
          intervention strategies.

          Vaccine Hesitancy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Vaccine hesitancy in Kano is influenced by misinformation,
          complacency, convenience, and confidence. KIRCT’s approach centers on
          trust and community engagement, working with religious leaders,
          community figures, and healthcare workers to build confidence and
          address misconceptions. The Centre collaborates with media and
          government institutions to strengthen vaccination uptake across
          northern Nigeria.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A reliable vaccine cold chain is essential for maintaining potency,
          safety, and effectiveness. Despite Nigeria’s power and transport
          challenges, KIRCT maintains a 24-hour power supply to ensure a
          functional and reliable cold chain system. This infrastructure supports
          safe vaccine storage and delivery during immunization campaigns.
